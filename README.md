# 🛠️ BFHL - Full Stack API Challenge (Chitkara July 2025)

This is a Spring Boot REST API submission built for the **Chitkara Campus Hiring API Round - July 2025**.

The challenge was to create a hosted REST API that accepts an array of mixed values and returns:
- Even numbers
- Odd numbers
- Uppercased alphabets
- Special characters
- Sum of all numeric values
- Concatenated string of alphabet characters (in reverse, alternating caps)

The entire logic is implemented and hosted using **Java 21 + Spring Boot**, deployed on **Render**, and submitted via the official form.
